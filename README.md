The Odin Project / Foundations Course / Project: Recipes

For the first project in the web design foundations course,
I made a basic website (no CSS) that links to a few recipes.
This demonstrates a few important HTML skills, including:
* Creating webpages via HTML files with proper boilerplate setup
* Using basic text, links, and images in HTML
* Basic project management with Git / GitHub
